a simple macro for my repository: Dilluti0n/baekjun that uses jekyll to run its [documentation site](https://dilluti0n.github.io/baekjun). This macro automatically merges the `sol/xxxx.md` file in the directory `sol/` of the baekjun repository with the `xxxx.(extension)` file in the folder named after each source code's extension (e.g. `py/`, `c/`) and uploads it to the site.
