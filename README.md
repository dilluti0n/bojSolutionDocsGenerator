a simple macro for repository [dilluti0n/baekjun](https://github.com/dilluti0n/baekjun) which uses jekyll to run its [documentation site](https://dilluti0n.github.io/baekjun). This macro automatically merges the `assets/sol/xxxx.md` file of the repository with the `xxxx.(extension)` file in the folder named after each source code's extension (e.g. `py/`, `c/`) and uploads it to the site.
